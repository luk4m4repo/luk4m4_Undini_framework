Static Mesh Level Placement Script for Unreal Engine
-----------------------------------------

This script is the eighth step in the Undini procedural generation pipeline:
1. Export splines from Unreal Engine (000_export_splines_as_json.py)
2. Export GenZone meshes from UE (010_export_gz_to_mod.py)
3. Process building data in Houdini (100_headless_topnet_PCGHD.py)
4. Import CSV files back into Unreal Engine (110_reimport_datatable.py)
5. Create PCG graphs in Unreal Engine (120_create_pcg_graph.py)
6. Generate sidewalks and roads in Houdini (200_headless_topnet_SWR.py)
7. Import sidewalk and road meshes into Unreal Engine (210_reimport_SM.py)
8. Add sidewalks and roads to the level (this script)

This script finds all static meshes with names matching the specified iteration number
pattern and adds them to the current level in organized folders.

Usage:
    From Python in Unreal Engine:
    ```python
    import add_SM_sidewalks_and_roads_to_level
    add_SM_sidewalks_and_roads_to_level(iteration_number=5)
    ```

    Or run directly:
    ```
    python 220_add_SM_to_lvl.py
    ```

    Adds sidewalk and road static meshes to the current level for a specific iteration.
    
    Args:
        iteration_number (int): The iteration number to use when finding assets.

    Returns:
        bool: True if assets were added successfully, False otherwise.
    
    This finds all static meshes with names starting with 'sidewalks_{iteration_number}_piece_' 
    and 'road_{iteration_number}_piece_', then adds them to the level in organized folders.
